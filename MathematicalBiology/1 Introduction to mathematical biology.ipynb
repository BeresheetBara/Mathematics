## 1 Introduction to mathematical biology
### Dynamic System
model concentrations, populations, locations, etc., over time, using ordinary differential equations, or ODE.
$N(t)$&emsp;:population of bacteria over time
Assume $N(t)$, $t$ are real numbers<br>
$ \frac{dN(t)}{dt}={K}\cdot{N} $ &emsp; ${N'}\sim{N}$<br>
Differential eq: unknown is a function $N(t)$ satisfying ${N'}=Kâˆ™N$
