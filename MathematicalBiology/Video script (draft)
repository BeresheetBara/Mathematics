I decided to make a video that showed the basics skills how I convert the classroom notes to numerical understanding in Python, say, Jupyter Notebook. This does not necessarily represent how Jupyter Notebook should be used, but it is my beginnerâ€™s guide as these are the simple features that I use, without having to shell out for a more advanced movie editor. Views of the software are purely my own and not everyone may agree that this is the best way to use Jupyter Notebook, but this demonstrates how I use it and how easy it is.
